Hello! My name is David Situ.

I am Observant, Cheesy, and "Hokage-material". 

		My favorite animal is the elephant. Although they are very large animals,
	they are altruistic and kind. Elephants are communal animals, socializing in groups.
	In fact, elephants hold funerals for their loved ones. On a last note, elephants have 
	amazing memories due to their large hippocampuses. For example, there was a story about 
	two circus elephants who were reunited after 40 years showed emotions of overjoy and excitement.
